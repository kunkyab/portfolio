            <h1> About me</h1>
            <p>My name is <span style="color: rgb(255, 176, 127);">Tenzin kunkyab</span>. I have keen interest in the Frontend Web Developer. 

                In my career as a motivated Frontend Web Developer, I have acquired extensive knowledge in web development, utilizing a diverse set of programming languages, frameworks, and tools. My experience includes successful project development and deployment, ranging from applications and websites to web services. I am highly organized, detail-oriented, and possess a knack for finding creative solutions to challenging problems.
                
                My technical skills include proficiency in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, MongoDB, React, Responsive Design, Tailwind CSS, SQL, Git, and Jest for JavaScript testing. I have hands-on experience in various projects, such as a React Shopping Cart website, a Password Generator app using Tailwind CSS, a Background Changer app, an Amazon Clone with HTML and CSS, and more, which can be viewed here.
                
                I hold a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science Engineering from Indo Global College of Engineering, graduating in 2015 under IK Gujral Punjab Technical University, India.
                
                Throughout my professional journey, I have gained valuable experience through internships and employment. During my 6-month internship at Softrix Solution, I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, PHP, and WordPress. At Tibet Action Institute, I played a crucial role in creating a website https://en.guchusum1991.org/ by retrieving and migrating data from the old website, working with WordPress, and setting up a server for a wired chat and data storage. Additionally, my tenure at the Library of Tibetan Works & Archives involved designing, maintaining, and implementing responsive websites using HTML5, CSS, and jQuery for over 3 years.
                
                Fluent in Tibetan, English, and Hindi, I possess strong communication skills and adaptability to diverse environments.
                
                I am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and creative mindset to any company i join. I believe that my skills align seamlessly with the requirements of the Frontend Web Developer role.
